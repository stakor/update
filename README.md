### What is update.sh?

Just a short bash script to knock out all the updates that must be done with a system. I would advise against running on production, but if you have a new system that needs lots of updates - not a horrible way of just knocking them out. 

Nothing fancy. Just updates repositories, and then updates system.

### Usage:

./update.sh

Should be run as root, to allow for updating of system.
